# 💧 Water Level cum Pump Motor Indicator

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Water Level cum Pump Motor Indicator** is a simple yet effective system designed to monitor the water level in a tank and automatically control the water pump. It provides visual indicators for different water levels and ensures the pump is turned on/off accordingly to prevent overflow or dry-run situations.

## 🔧 Features
- 🚰 Detects multiple water levels (Empty, Low, Medium, Full)
- 🟢 LED indicators for each water level
- ⚙️ Automatic pump control
  - Turns ON the motor when water is LOW
  - Turns OFF the motor when the tank is FULL
- 🔋 Low power consumption
- 🔒 Protects motor from dry run and prevents water wastage

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- Probes are placed at various levels in the water tank.
- As water rises, it completes circuits through probes to indicate levels via LEDs.
- When the level drops below a certain point, the pump is automatically turned on via relay.
- When water reaches the top level, the pump is turned off.
- Manual override or sensor-based automation is possible.
